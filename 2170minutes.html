<h1>Theoretical examination of a healthy life in a technocratic society <br> “2170 Minutes”</h1>
<b>January, 2024</b>
<p> It's ironic how easy it was for me to fill 217 pages within a month, but in writing this introduction, I fail at the very first sentence. The idea of me taking ten minutes seven times a day to write with a pen on paper didn't strike me as abstruse at first. In the spirit of McRorie’s “Uptaught” and the initial exercise in David Quigley’s seminar: “Making the Right Time and Place | Experiments in Collective Creation”, I began to put this project into practice. The question that hovered over me like a cloud all this time was: <b>How can a person still be human in a technocratic society — to escape increasing alienation and disembodiment without leaving life?</b> The latter can be found in American philosophy — from Waldo Emerson to Henry David Thoreau. But the phenomenologists of the 20th century also dealt with the dichotomy of body and mind.<p>
<p>Free writing helps to activate the stream of consciousness and is used in the creative industry as a tool for the production of ideas. But what if the decisive momentum lies within writing as an act in itself? Writing for the sake of writing. The way in which writing is done plays an important role here. Which paper is used? Which writing instrument? If a fountain pen, what nib strength? Which ink? All these questions have one thing in common: they lead to a physical manifestation of what is written, unlike typing into a machine-like device that merely translates our input, and in some cases, codes it as a sequence of numbers and stores it in an intangible vacuum. Even the typewriter had an influence on the user’s thought process. </p>
<p>The first writing sphere was an invention that the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche gratefully accepted, as the quality of his eyesight was increasingly deteriorating. But he also noticed a change in his thought process: “The typewriter is screwy”, he wrote, and to his secretary Heinrich K&ouml;selitz he summarized: “Our writing utensils collaborate in our thoughts.” Now, however, it is not just writing itself that is changing through the use of technological media, but our entire perception of the world. </p>
<p>This project was a counter-program to the flight from machines, the intrusion of digital reality into our everyday lives, and the disappearance of signs. What remains after reality has dissolved? The hyperreality? The questions about digitality are of the utmost importance. The silence, apathy, and passivity that prevail in a technocracy that has become reality seem to nip any revolutionary thought in the bud before it can even be formulated. What remains is maximum artificiality, as Jean Baudrillard once described it. The way out is the death revolt, or, as he admitted a little later in his main work from 1976 “The Symbolic Exchange and Death”, poetry...
