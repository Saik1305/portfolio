<h1>Corporate Identity <br> “3D-Form”</h1>
<b>December, 2022</b>
<p>
	The 3D-Form logo supports the company's steadfastness and stability of the company.
It conveys precision and inspires confidence. The O in 3D-Form is a cube in which the negative color space represents the hallmark. The rest is “milled” from the logo to match the company's working area of the company. To support the suggestion of trust, the entire color scheme is kept in a shade of blue. In color psychology, blue stands for the calm, the balance and the vastness.</p>
<p>
The logo also exists in black and white and grayscale to create a
powerful effect with colorless company stamps or as a display print. There are 2 versions of the logo. The first is the wordmark, which can be used everywhere and the second is the figurative mark, which was created from the O in the word mark. This is used for areas of application that that are not so broad in scope.
