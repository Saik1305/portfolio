<h1>Corporate Identity <br> “3D-Form”</h1>
<b>December, 2022</b>
<p>
This project was a fictional job, where we had to develop a complete corporate identity for an existing company. I chose 3D-Form, which is based in Stuttgart and specializes in metal processing and measuring/testing technology.
The logo I designed supports the company's steadfastness and stability.
It conveys precision and inspires confidence. The O in 3D-Form is a cube in which the negative color space represents the hallmark. The rest is “milled” from the logo to match the company's working area. To support the suggestion of trust, the entire color scheme is kept a shade of blue. In color psychology, blue stands for the calm, the balance and the vastness.</p>
<p>
The logo also exists in black and white and grayscale to create a
powerful effect with colorless company stamps or as a display print. There are two versions of the logo. The first is the wordmark, which can be used everywhere, and the second is the figurative mark, which was created from the O in the word mark. This is used for areas of application that are not so broad in scope.
</p>
<p> Everything else is built around that concept — the letterheads, envelopes, business cards, miscellaneous merchandise articles, and the prototype for a website, which I made in Adobe XD.
