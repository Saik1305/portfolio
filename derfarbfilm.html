<h1>Final project <br> “The color film — just playing with senses?”</h1>
<b>April, 2022</b>
<p>Since the very beginning of cinema history, filmmakers have been trying to get closer to reality by adding new dimensions to film through technical innovations. To what extent this development took place in the first place and how it corresponds with film theorists will be answered in my paper. I would also like to question the thesis that colors are only “sensory stimuli” and that “educated people [...] have some aversion to colors”. (Goethe's Theory of Colors). I would like to achieve this through suitable examples such as Vertigo (juxtaposition with Psycho); Paris, Texas and Suspiria. Here are some important key points: Color theory, color symbolism and what the colorful can express that the black and white cannot. Generally speaking, I want to find out why color is so impressive for people and what significance it has in cinema.

<p>“Gegenschuss” is a film magazine for film art that is published about twice a year. The boundaries between the media are supposed to merge here - it's not quite a book, but not a magazine either - just as the boundaries in film merge. “Gegenschuss” is dedicated to cineastes and film lovers and, above all, to people who want to take a closer look at specific topics. The issues are structured in such a way that they consist of two large sections each time: one part deals with the cinema landscape of a city (e.g. Berlin, Frankfurt, Lyon, New York City) and the other part is dedicated to a design topic in film (e.g. sound, editing, actors, etc.).</p>
<p>The format of the magazine corresponds to the Mediabook format 14.2 x 19.2 cm. It therefore fits perfectly with the mediabooks in the film collection, which most readers of this publication will probably have.  The content is oriented towards film studies, while the design is intended to be a little different from the “classic concept” of the typical mediabook booklet.</p>
