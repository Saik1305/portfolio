<h1>Final project <br> “The color film — just playing with our senses?”</h1>
<b>April, 2022</b>
<p>Since the very beginning of cinema history, filmmakers have been trying to get closer to reality by adding new dimensions to film through technical innovations. To what extent this development took place in the first place and how it corresponds with the film theorists I wanted to answer in the paper I wrote for my “final thesis”. The work was also an engagement with color theory, where they are regarded as only “sensory stimuli” and that “educated people [...] have some aversion to colors”. (Goethe's Theory of Colors). I wanted to achieve this through suitable examples such as <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>Suspiria</i>. Here are some important key points: Color theory, color symbolism, and what the colorful can express that the black and white cannot. Generally speaking, I wanted to find out why color is so impressive for people and what significance it has in cinema.
</p>
<p>Thus, for my thesis, “The color film — just playing with senses?” I developed a concept in which such text could be published twice a year in a film magazine called “Gegenschuss”. The boundaries between the media are supposed to merge here — it's not quite a book, but not a magazine either — just as the boundaries in film merge. “Gegenschuss” is dedicated to cineastes and film lovers and, above all, to people who want to take a closer look at specific topics. The issues are structured in such a way that they consist of two large sections each time: one part deals with the cinema landscape of a city (e.g., Berlin, Frankfurt, Lyon, New York City), and the other part is dedicated to a design topic in film (e.g., sound, editing, actors, etc.).</p>
<p>The format of the magazine corresponds to the Mediabook format of 14.2 x 19.2 cm. It therefore fits perfectly with the mediabooks in the film collection, which most readers of this publication will probably have. The content is oriented towards film studies, while the design is intended to be a little different from the “classic concept” of the typical mediabook booklet.</p>
