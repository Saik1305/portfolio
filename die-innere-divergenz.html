<h1>Experimental book project <br> “The Internal Divergence”</h1>
<b>February, 2024</b>
<p> When talking about processes, it is difficult to avoid post-structuralism. Since the beginning of human history, “things” have been defined in terms of their ontological purpose. In language, they are and remain static. A stone remains a stone, but a stone also decays and changes. In cinema, this change has been visualized in “time-images” since the post-war period (more specifically in neo-realism). Gilles Deleuze defines these images as a blending of the imaginary and the real; as a culmination of the actual and the virtual; as an intersection between memory and perception. </p>
<p>My aim in this project was to present this concept of time in film systematically — in the sense of a contemplative design — on the basis of Deleuze’s work by focusing on typography and intertwining it with an experimental book. The book consists of 24 acrylic glass plates, which have been screen-printed. The 24 plates are analogous to cinema, representing exactly one second. An opaque black slipcase holds the plates at the end, thus protecting the “inner divergence” and its innermost germ. At the same moment of interaction with the plates, the deconstruction of the design within grid systems will also become tangible and palpable. The book was produced between January and February 2024.
