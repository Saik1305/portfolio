<h1>An independent brochure project <br> “(almost) forgotten words”</h1>
<b>July, 2021</b>
<p> When we talk about (almost) forgotten German words, we should be aware that in lexicology such words are referred to as “archaisms” and are often used as stylistic devices in rhetoric. The term archaism was Latinized from the ancient Greek and means something like “former” or “old”. These are words whose frequency of use is decreasing. This can have internal or external reasons. In the first case, a word is replaced by a more modern, new-sounding term, whereas in the second case, the object that the word describes disappears from our everyday lives.
describes disappears from our everyday lives. Like celluloid, for example.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, films can also become “archaic” in a figurative sense. In “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” from 1919, Robert Wiene creates one of the most influential films of all time and depicts the suffering and horror of the First World War in an expressionist manner. But who still talks about it? Which major streaming service offers this film in its program to introduce it to a new generation? This is precisely the task set by the magazine. Words that should not be forgotten any more than the films that shaped the same period.
