<h1>Book cover <br> “Samuel Beckett, Mirlitonnades”</h1>
<b>May, 2022</b>
<p>
	Loneliness and silence are themes that always accompany Samuel Beckett’s works. In the exemplary poem on the reverse, a surreal, sombre mood emerges, among other things. His works are also accompanied by the form of repetition, but also by irregularity. This irregularity can be found in the design of the cover: An unfinished and flat acrylic painting with self-set letters. There is also a certain stillness to the typeface on the back, which is created by the wide spacing and small font size. Due to the depression from which Samuel Beckett suffered, I decided to take this aspect into account the most and to depict the emptiness and loneliness. I therefore kept the color scheme somber. The decision to work with acrylic also came from the fact that this is a book of poems and poems are often associated with the art scene.

	<p>am Ende welcher Wachsamkeit</p>
	<p>glaubte das Auge</p>
	<p>undeutlich leichte Bewegung zu sehn</p>
	<p>der Kopf beruhigte es, sagte</p>
	<p>das war nur im Kopf so”</p>
