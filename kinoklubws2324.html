<h1>Program curation and advertising material <br> “KinoKlub”</h1>
<b>Winter semester 2023/24</b>
<p> The Cinema Club („KinoKlub“) at the Merz Academy is a project that was brought to life by my fellow student Uliana Drashchenko in 2021. Within this club, we meet regularly to watch a wide variety of films and engage in a (semi-)scientific discourse about them. The pandemic changed the structure of the academy — the idea was to bring back the social component of movie watching that has always been inherent to this act through cinema culture. </p>
<p>
In the winter semester 23/24, I was given the opportunity to take over the management of this club and not only curate a program, but also design and produce the promotional materials. My program “Technological Terror - Media Reflexivity in Horror Film” dealt with the question of how different films portray (new) media and why this usually takes place in the mode of the horror film. Above all, my personal goal was to connect film studies theories with popular culture films such as “The Ring“ and to make them fruitful for further in-depth reflection. For the promotional material I designed a poster, program flyers and slides for Instagram, which you can see above.</p>
