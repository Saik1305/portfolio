<h1>Creating a brochure <br> “Kracauer’s realism / Arnheim’s shaping”</h1>
<b>January, 2023</b>
<p> Rudolf Arnheim argued in favor of the form. He saw the technical shortcomings of film at the time as potential for creating great art. The lack of color and sound, for example, are sometimes better prerequisites for achieving precisely that. The cinematic image frame and the average length of 90 minutes should also be mentioned — to be compared with the complete film of today. These limitations lead to a lack of reality and this is precisely where Arnheim comes in. While for Siegfried Kracauer a film is cinematic the smaller the difference between the representation and the depicted, for Arnheim it is the other way around. Nevertheless, the two maintained an open pen friendship, even though they were mirror images. Even in modern discourse, some of Arnheim’s theses fall flat. Just think of the complex color dramaturgies of Suspiria (Dario Argento, 1977), or Paris, Texas (Wim Wenders, 1984). You can also think of films that achieve a specific expressive power because of their length, such as the works of Béla Tar. Regardless of this, Arnheim, unlike Kracauer, would not like the current development.
