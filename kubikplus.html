<h1>Architecture magazine project <br> “Kubik+”</h1>
<b>May, 2022</b>
<p> For the final exams in our vocational training as graphic designers, we had to develop a visual concept for a fictional architecture magazine called “Kubik+” and design a logo for it.
I wanted the logo of the magazine to appear “constructed” and technical, but not too technical and serious. Architecture often relates to form and construction in a playful way, which is why this aspect can sometimes be found in the logo. </p>
<p> I chose a square format for the magazine, in keeping with the name “Kubik+”. This format also allowed me to play with the shape and go into the width, or to let the text flow symmetrically around the square. Due to the format, the title no longer stands out in a sales display, which is why a 20x30 cm gray board is planned to be placed behind the displayed magazines.
The colors are neutral in certain shades that create warmth. These warm gray tones find their origin in the modern home furnishings that can be seen in the illustrations, among others.
I used arrows, (dotted) lines, and geometric shapes as design elements to reflect the design character of an architectural working style.
