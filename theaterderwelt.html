<h1>Photo series <br> “World Theater”</h1>
<b>November, 2021</b>
<p>“Theater der Welt” is an international theater festival that was founded in 1981 by the German center of the International Theater Institute (ITI). The ITI awards the festival to a city in Germany every three years via an application process.</p>
<p>In this fictional job, we had to produce a photo series, which would represent the artistic qualities of theatre.
Therefore, the pictorial statement must contain the worldly character and abstraction. I wanted to challenge the viewer with my pictorial statement and make them think. I used a very dark color spectrum in my visual language. At most one, maximum two colors as highlights. The photographs are intended to evoke associations with bloody horror films/gialli (à la Dario Argento). The images should trigger an unpleasant feeling. “The theater is dead”, but the emotions triggered in the viewer by the photos bring it back to life.</p>
