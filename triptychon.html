<h1>Photo series <br> “Triptych Self-Portraits”</h1>
<b>November, 2022</b>
<p>With this project, I wanted to explore the limits of self-portraiture. The question I was dealing with at the same time was the visualization of recipients in a (post-)digital world. Especially as a movie watcher, it was interesting for me to play with what it might look like if someone were to watch me watching a movie. I was also thinking of Hitchcock’s “Rear Window”.</p>
<p>In the course of this occupation in digital space, I designed my photo series as a triptych in order to include the additive color system through a three-part structure, i.e., red, green, and blue. I worked with focus shifts and depth of field, with mirrors and the “screen” as such, which also appears here.</p>
