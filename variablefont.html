<h1>Experimenting with Glyphs 3 <br> “Breaking Type Workshop”</h1>
<b>November, 2023</b>
<p> In this workshop hosted by <a href="https://celine-hurka.com/" target="blank">Céline Hurka</a>, we worked with the program Glyphs to create our own variable fonts. At first, we walked around the building, searching for inspiration that would help us begin working. This also reflects my own personal working process, when starting new projects — for me, the textualization is as important as the end result and an important part of the journey. </p>
<p>I used many different writing tools and techniques to get where I wanted to go with my font. I was inspired by the stark contrast between the upstrokes and downstrokes of Bodoni. So I traced the final drawings I made for the font in Glpyhs and pretentiously called my first draft <i>Bodoni Neue</i>. The animations (except the rotating glass one) were done using <a href="https://variabletime.pointer.click/" target="blank">“Variable Time”</a> — a program developed by Studio Pointer*. The rotating glass animation I did in Blender.</p>
